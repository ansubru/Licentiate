I would like to thank my supervisors, Niklas Andersson at Chalmers and Fredrik Wallin at GKN Aerospace for their neverending support and guidence, especially when I ask them to help me last minute.

Thanks to my colleagues and friends at Chalmers who give me a great working environment, where would I be without all those fikas. To Adam Jareteg my roommate, I would like to give special thanks for always being up for discussions, no matter how much interest he has in the subject, work wise or not and to be willing to listen to me butchering the Swedish language.

I would like to thank my family who has given the possibility to expand the world I live in and always supporting me. Last, but deffinetly not the least, my girlfriend Guðrún for always being there, helping me making my dreams come true.
